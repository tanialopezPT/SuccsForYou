Fun little project using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. I love working with succulents at home and thought it would be cool to create a single page app for a faux company that delivers succulents to your door. I really liked the colors I chose and the images make it clean and simple. Site is fully responsive, I also added a signup page when you click to signup for any of the packages.
